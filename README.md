For this project, my client was Artemis Financial, a company focused on creating personalized financial plans for its customers. They wanted to improve their software security by adding a way to verify file integrity and ensure secure communication during data transfer. My main task was to identify and address security gaps in their existing application and then implement a solution using modern secure coding practices.

One of the things I did well was integrating SHA-256 hashing to verify the integrity of static data. This allowed the application to produce a consistent checksum, which is a simple but powerful way to detect data tampering. Secure coding is important because even small vulnerabilities can be exploited and lead to data breaches. By building security into the code early on, companies like Artemis Financial can build customer trust and protect their reputation.

The most challenging part of the vulnerability assessment was understanding how to properly configure and apply the self-signed SSL certificate to enable HTTPS in a local environment. However, going through that process helped me understand the importance of encrypted data transmission and how certificates work behind the scenes. To add multiple layers of security, I configured HTTPS, implemented cryptographic hashing, and ran a dependency check using OWASP tools. In the future, I’d use static analysis tools like OWASP Dependency-Check, and also explore dynamic analysis tools for runtime vulnerabilities.

To make sure the code was secure and functional, I tested the /hash endpoint in the browser and verified that it worked correctly with my custom string and checksum. I also ran a Maven-based dependency check after refactoring the code to confirm that no new vulnerabilities were introduced. Some of the tools I used, like the OWASP plugin and Spring Boot’s security settings, will definitely help in future projects. If an employer asked for an example of my work, I’d show them this project because it demonstrates how I can improve an existing system by adding security features, follow software development best practices, and verify my work using both testing and analysis tools.
